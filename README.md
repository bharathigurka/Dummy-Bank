A dummy frontend without any backend capablity, made with Angular 10.

The app is built to consider the data from mockdata static file,
if data provided in such format through API's , apis can be consumed easily and do a build using a specific API or ENV.

### Followed Best Practises:

[x] Linting
[x] Tests
[x] pre-commit, pre-push hooks
etc.
